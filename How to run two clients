HOW TO RUN TWO IDENA CLIENTS ON SAME DESKTOP
THIS GUIDES ASSUMES YOU'RE USING PUTTY (vps) AND YOU'RE ON WINDOWS.
 
YOU NEED TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT ON YOUR PC, THIS SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY UNLESS YOU'RE RETARDED OR ANDREWIDENA. 
FOR SIMPLICITY FOR THE SECOND ACCOUNT USE SIMPLE CREDENTIALS SUCH AS username: idena, password: idena (REMEMBER YOU DON'T NEED AN EMAIL TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT ON YOUR PC).
NOW THAT YOU HAVE CREATED YOUR SECOND ACCOUNT LOG INTO IT AND DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL IDENA.
OPEN IDENA AND LET IT START (YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT SYNC).
NOW CLOSE IDENA AND REBOOT YOUR PC.
LOGIN INTO FIRST ACCOUNT.
NAVIGATE TO C:\Users\secondaccountname\AppData\Local\Programs\idena-desktop
RIGHT CLICK ON IDENA.EXE AND SEND TO -> DESKTOP
GO TO DESKTOP, RENAME THE EXE TO IDENA2 SO YOU DON'T GET CONFUSED.
TO OPEN IT AS SECOND ACCOUNT DO ctrl+shift+rightclick ON THE IDENA2 ICON AND CHOOSE "OPEN AS OTHER USER". PUT IN THE CREDENTIALS ON YOUR SECOND ACCOUNT. 
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO OPEN YOUR SECOND CLIENT. YOU CAN STILL OPEN YOUR FIRST CLIENT NORMALLY.
 
how to set up putty for the second client (ASSUMING YOU'RE USING TWO DIFFERENT VPSES)
 
OPEN PUTTY, CREATE NEW SESSION WITH SECOND VPS'S IP AND SAVE IT AS idena2 
NOW IN TUNNELS YOU NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT DOOR SO PUT :SOURCE PORT = 9990 and DESTINATION = localhost:9011. remember to save.
ALMOST DONE: NOW IN SECOND CLIENT CHOOSE TO RUN REMOTE NODE AND PUT IN NODE ADDRESS localhost:9990
LAST CRUCIAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. WHEN YOU RUN PUTTY, TO CONNECT CORRECTLY TO SECOND CLIENT YOU CAN'T JUST USE screen ./idena-go BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
screen ./idena-go --rpcport 9011   <-- THIS WILL MAKE YOUR VPS USE THE RIGHT PORT
YOU CAN STILL RUN FIRST NODE WITH NORMAL COMMAND screen ./idena-go
